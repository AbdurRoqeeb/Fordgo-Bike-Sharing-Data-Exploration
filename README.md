This [data set](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv) includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The dataset contained 16 columns and 183412 rows. I perfomed a preliminary wrangling on the data and the shape of the data became 24 columns and 174952 after data cleaning and feature engineering.


## Summary of Findings
The following can be deduced from the exploratory data analysis:
- Number of trips on weekdays is generally more than that of weekends, with Thursday being the day most trips occured and Sunday being the day with the least.
- A very large proportion of the users are subscribers, with very few users who are customers
- Most of the users are male.
- The age of users ranges from 20 to 80, with most users being between 20-40 years age bracket.
- Average duration of trips by customers is twice as much as those by subscribers.


## Key Insights for Presentation
